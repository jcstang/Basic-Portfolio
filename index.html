        <p>Hello and Welcome! I will try to give you insight into the whirlwind of ideas in my mind. I'm a husband and father of 4 (1 on the way). I decided to convert my basement into a reptile den. We have 5 snakes, 6 geckos, 2 bearded dragons, and 2 tortoises. Maybe too small of a number to be called a den? I <strong>LOVE</strong> to fiddle and tinker around with things. It drives my family crazy! I love to learn new things! I enjoy wondering around the hardware store and just looking at stock on the shelf and imagine the projects I could do. I'm a big gearhead, I've had car posters in my room ever since I was young. On my birthday my wife suprised me with a track day. I was able to drive around the track in a Ferrari 488 GTB, WOW cool experience. </p>
        <p>I've always been instersted in all things tech. I remember the day I bought my first iPod. I have been pretty steadily going to college since 2011. I used to be a mechanical engineering major. After too many credits and years, I was prompted by family to switch to computer science. I loved it! I was in my element, finacially became too overwhelming. I felt llike I was paying too much money to not getting my fiddling hands on some code! I have a HUGE drive to learn, I then went on months learning anything from the internet. I went down a route of learning Node.js, Angular, Swift, ios development, and many others. One of my roles I was part of the Business Intelligence department. I learned a lot of practical experience of how data should be organized and stored. I was not a developer but I worked with a team of them. T-SQL, SOAP/REST, and Salesforce code and implementation were part of my everyday life. </p>
        <p>Welp, here is a summary:    </p>
        <ul>
